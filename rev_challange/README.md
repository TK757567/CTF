# reverse challange

```
Marshal is a nice guy i love him he really loves sauces, he gave me these 2 files with encrypted data but i don't know what to do with them.
He said that the marshal file is the encryption code and stored the data in the other file, but i don't know what kind of code is this, i only know that it's base64.
