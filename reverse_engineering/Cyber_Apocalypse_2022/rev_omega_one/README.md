# omega-one

_omega-one_ is an easy reverse challenge.

in this challenge we have an output file that contains some random names

```
Crerceon 
Ezains   
Ummuh
Zonnu
Vinzo
Cuzads
Emoi
Ohols
Groz'ens
Ukox
Ehnu 
.
.
.
etc
```
and an excutable file _omega-one_, I have tried to excute it but didn't have any thing special.

let's open it in _IDA_ shall we.

It seems that in the main function it's calling 3 different functions _sub_1673_ , _sub_2120_ and _sub_1870_ .
